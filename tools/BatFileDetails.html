<body>
In general, see <a href="http://ss64.com/nt/">http://ss64.com/nt/</a> for tons of 
useful info about Windows batch files.  It's the documentation that MS never 
bothered to write.
<p>
<pre>
setlocal
</pre>	
This command establishes a local scope for environment variables so that 
they don't pollute the command shell's environment.  The local scope is 
in effect until the end of the batch file.
<pre>
if not "%~1"=="" (
	set "_arg1=%~f1"
) else (
	set "_arg1=%CD%"
)
</pre>	
<tt>%~1</tt> is like <tt>%1</tt> (first argument) but it removes the quotes that may 
surround the argument.  One should always use <tt>"%~1"</tt> instead of <tt>%1</tt> 
so that quoted arguments are handled correctly.  It's the only way to sanely handle 
stupidity like the "My Documents" folder!
<p>
This is from JackCompiler.bat.  If an argument is supplied, <tt>set&nbsp;"_arg1=%~f1"</tt> 
sets <tt>_arg1</tt> to the fully qualified path for argument 1.  If no argument is 
supplied, <tt>_arg1</tt> is set to the fully qualified path for the current 
working directory.
<p>
For the other tools, there is no need to set <tt>_arg1</tt> if there is no argument.
<pre>
pushd "%~dp0"
</pre>
Saves the current working directory and changes to the directory containing the batch 
file.  <tt>%~dp0</tt> returns the drive and path for argument 0 (the batch file name).  
There will be a matching <tt>popd</tt> at the end of the batch file.
<pre>
if "%~1"=="" (
  start javaw -classpath "%CLASSPATH%;.;bin/classes;bin/lib/Hack.jar;bin/lib/HackGUI.jar;bin/lib/Simulators.jar;bin/lib/SimulatorsGUI.jar;bin/lib/Compilers.jar" ^
    HardwareSimulatorMain
) else (
  echo Running "%_arg1%"
  java -classpath "%CLASSPATH%;.;bin/classes;bin/lib/Hack.jar;bin/lib/HackGUI.jar;bin/lib/Simulators.jar;bin/lib/SimulatorsGUI.jar;bin/lib/Compilers.jar" ^
    HardwareSimulatorMain "%_arg1%"
)
</pre>
The <tt>^</tt> at the end of the long lines is a line-continuation character supported by 
cmd.exe.  Unfortunately, it cannot bu used to break the long quoted string path.
<p>
If no argument is supplied, <tt>javaw</tt> is started to run the tool in a stand-alone 
window.  The batch file does not wait for the tool to exit.
<p>
If there is an argument, <tt>java</tt> is used to run the tool and the batch file waits 
for the tool to exit before it continues.
</body>
