###project 1-11 have all been finisehd. NEARLY 1 MONTH. The most meaningful month this year. However, there are too many details to be taken care of in project 12 and I have little knowledge of how to do ( as a student majoring in humanities). So, good Bye, project 12. But I promise I will return soon after I know more, and get more and better CS skills.
